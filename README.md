## üìä Key Analysis & Insights
The data analysis covers a dataset of 15,000 AI job entries and provides key insights into:

Average Salaries: Analyze salary distribution globally (in USD) to understand the financial landscape of AI roles.

Fun Fact: The dataset shows salaries ranging from approximately $32k USD to nearly $400k USD.

In-Demand Skills: Discover the most frequently required technical skills, such as Python, Deep Learning, SQL, Kubernetes, and more.

Experience vs. Pay: Compare salaries across different experience levels (e.g., Entry, Mid-level, Senior, Executive).

Work Arrangement: Examine the ratio of fully remote (100%), hybrid (50%), and on-site (0%) job opportunities.

Geographic Trends: Identify which industries and countries are hiring the most for AI and Data Science roles.
